    <h1>Futile Body</h1>
           <h2>by grimeyluv</h2>
    <p> 
This corpse of mine drags around <br>
from bed to school, it grinds on the pavement <br>
little by little, it shaves off my weight. <br>
I don't like this body, <br>
it's heavy and needy, <br>
always asking for food while high on worries <br>
like a tank without fuel, occupied by a baby. <br>
Time will pass as this body rots, slowly but surely <br>
my once smooth skin will droop to the ground <br>
and I will thaw into non-existing. <br>
    </p>
